This repository contains helpful/handy assets for use with [Manubot](https://manubot.org/ "Manubot"), a tool for writing scholarly manuscripts. 

Some things that are included:

- `/icons` - SVG icons for social media (eg Twitter), services (eg GitHub), and any other common brand identifiers.
- `/images` - Generic images for testing manuscript themes and plugins.

Some things that may be included later:

- `/fonts` - Manubot-approved or special purpose fonts.
- `/themes` / `/plugins` - The theme and plugin files from `manubot-rootstock`, hosted here instead to make that repository less cluttered.
